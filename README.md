Odin project javascript notes and practices

# Odin Project Fundamentals

I'm updating this because I am back to learn more about Javascript, I have been in the application
process so I took some time to focus on resume applications and personal websites. I need to learn JavaScript to jump into node.js and some other technologies my job
may require.

# Here are some technologies I need to continue to learn in

[Bootstrap]
[SCSS/SASS]
[Grunt.js/Node.js]
[JQuery]
[AJAX]
[CoffeeScript]
[Bourbon]
